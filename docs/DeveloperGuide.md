# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

All the code base is developed internally by the DEV team and any libraries used are default libraries found within the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

## Design & implementation

### Architecture

![](team/Architecture%20Diagram.jpeg)

The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the program.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

`UI`: The UI of the App. It requests for user inputs and displays corresponding outputs


`Main (Run)`: Found within UI, it takes in a user input, parses it and executes the appropriate command


`Command`: List of actions that can be performed based on defined user inputs


`Storage`: Storage of Library / Borrower

### Sequence Diagram

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario when user has already keyed in
his username and then issues the command `list/library`

### Storage Component

The **Storage Component** displays the types of storage classes within it. The UI / Parser classes load / add various information using
different components within the Storage Class.
